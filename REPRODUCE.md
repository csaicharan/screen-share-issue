## Steps:

1. Run the app in IOS device (in my case its iPad mini).
2. Start screen mirroring to a device (in my case its iMac).
3. Click on the button "Click Me after starting the screen mirroring.".
4. Observe IOS device and the mirrored screen. 

## Things to observe
1. IOS device only shows the click me button instead with of alert message.
